description: How to compile and run the Linux Video Player
---

## 1. Prepare the Environment
Ensure you have a C compiler (`gcc`) installed on your DE10-Nano or a cross-compiler on your host.

## 2. Transfer Files
Copy the following files to your DE10-Nano (e.g., using `scp`):
*   `video_player.c`
*   `video_qhd.bin` (Generated by `video2raw.py` on your PC)

## 3. Compile the Player
Run this command on the DE10-Nano:
```bash
gcc -o video_player video_player.c -O3
```
// turbo
## 4. Run the Player
Execute the player with root privileges (required for `/dev/mem` access):
```bash
sudo ./video_player
```

## 5. (Optional) Run Python Conversion on PC
To generate the raw video file from an MP4:
```bash
python video2raw.py input_video.mp4
```
